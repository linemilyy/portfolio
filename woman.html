            <h3>For one of our bootcamp assignments, we were instructed to redesign an existing webpage to improve the overall user experience when interacting with the webpage. As my team an I were browsing through some non-profit organizations, we came across WomanInc. 
            </h3>
            <h3>The current WomanInc website lacks hierarchy, making it hard for users to easily find information in a timely manner. For our project, we proposed to redesign the layout of key web pages based on findings through our user tests. We restructured the information architecture and hierarchy after rounds of card sorting and design testing.  The overall goal from our project was to achieve a design that would help women navigate smoothly through Womaninc.org with speed.
